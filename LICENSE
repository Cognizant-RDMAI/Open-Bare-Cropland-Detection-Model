This document provides additional context and usage guidance specific to the Software distributed under the MIT License. It does not modify or override the terms of the MIT License.

**1. Research and Development Status**
The Software is a research and development artifact and reflects a point-in-time snapshot of an evolving project. It is provided without any commitment to accuracy, completeness, or performance. The  is not intended for production use or decision-making without independent validation. No party, including any member of the development consortium, is obligated to provide updates, maintenance, or support.

**2. Model Knowledge Cutoff**
The Software was trained on publicly available data up to April 2025. It may not reflect current scientific understanding, environmental conditions, or regulatory standards. Users are solely responsible for verifying the accuracy, timeliness, and applicability of any outputs.

**3. Experimental and Generative Nature**
The Software may exhibit limitations, including but not limited to:
- Inaccurate, incomplete, or misleading outputs
- Embedded biases or assumptions in training data
- Non-deterministic or unexpected behavior
- Limited transparency in model logic or decision-making

Users must critically evaluate all outputs and exercise independent scientific, legal, and technical judgment. The Software is not a substitute for professional expertise or regulatory compliance.

**4. Usage Considerations**
- Bias and Fairness: The Software may reflect biases present in its training data. Users are responsible for identifying and mitigating such biases in their applications.
- Ethical and Lawful Use: The Software is intended solely for lawful, ethical, and development purposes. It must not be used in any application that could result in harm to individuals, communities, or the environment, or that violates applicable laws or regulations.
